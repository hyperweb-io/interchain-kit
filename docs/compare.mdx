# Interchain Kit vs Cosmos Kit

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed comparison between Interchain Kit and Cosmos Kit, highlighting the advantages of Interchain Kit's new design that aims to improve developer experience and understanding.

## 1. Developer Usage Comparison

### Cosmos Kit

- **Learning Curve**: Steeper, requires understanding multiple layers of abstraction and complex API structures
- **Usage Pattern**: More complex configuration, usually requires more boilerplate code
- **Error Handling**: May require handling more error scenarios, error messages are less intuitive
- **Documentation**: Relatively comprehensive but potentially scattered, newcomers may need more time to understand

### Interchain Kit

- **Learning Curve**: More gradual, with more intuitive API design
- **Usage Pattern**: Clean API based on React hooks, reduces boilerplate code
- **Error Handling**: Provides clearer error messages and handling processes
- **Documentation**: Design focuses more on guidance, with examples closer to actual use cases

## 2. Architecture Comparison

### Cosmos Kit

- **Architectural Complexity**: Higher, with multiple layers of encapsulation and abstraction
- **State Management**: Uses complex state management logic
- **Dependencies**: More dependencies and cross-references
- **Extensibility**: Extensible but requires understanding more internal mechanisms

### Interchain Kit

- **Architectural Complexity**: Lower, with a flattened design
- **State Management**: More simplified and transparent state flow
- **Dependencies**: Reduces unnecessary dependencies, clearer module boundaries
- **Extensibility**: Provides clearer extension points, easier to customize

## 3. Feature Comparison

### Cosmos Kit

- **Wallet Support**: Supports multiple Cosmos ecosystem wallets
- **Chain Integration**: Provides integration with Cosmos ecosystem chains
- **Transaction Management**: Supports transaction creation and signing

### Interchain Kit

- **Wallet Support**: Similarly supports major Cosmos wallets, but with more consistent interfaces
- **Chain Integration**: Greater emphasis on cross-chain functionality, providing a smoother multi-chain experience
- **Transaction Management**: Simplified transaction flow, more intuitive API
- **Additional Features**: May provide more modern features, such as better mobile device support

## 4. Benefits of Using Interchain Kit Instead of Cosmos Kit

- **Improved Development Efficiency**: Reduces development time, more concise code, less boilerplate
- **Lower Maintenance Costs**: More understandable architecture means easier maintenance and debugging
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Potentially provides a smoother wallet connection and transaction experience
- **Better Testability**: More concise architecture typically means easier unit testing
- **More Modern Development Experience**: Better TypeScript type support and React best practices
- **Lower Learning Cost**: New team members can more quickly understand and work with the codebase
